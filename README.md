## Developer Tools

* The [Azure Tools for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradygaster.azuretoolsforvscode) adds commands to the Command Palette (F1) that make it easy to create and access Azure resources directly from VS Code. For example, you can create App Service Web Apps and Functions, Storage accounts, and browse to any number of resources in the Azure Portal.

* The [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools) for VS Code provides a rich editing experience for Azure Resource Manager deployment templates and template language expressions. For example, IntelliSense for TLE function names, parameter references, signature help, GoTo Definition, Peek Definitions, and Find All References (Shift+F12) as well as Errors and Warnings, making it quick and easy to author ARM templates in VS Code.

* The [Azure Node Essentials](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=azuresdkteam.azurenodeessentials) extension provides tools for NodeJs developers working with Azure SDKs. Maintained by the Azure Node SDK Team, this extension provides snippets and commands that generate code to work with the Azure Node.Js SDK.

## Micro-Services

The [Docker Tools for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PeterJausovec.vscode-docker) make it easy to develop and deploy containerized micro-service based applications using Docker containers. 

Azure provides a robust platform and infrastructure for building, deploying, and running your micro-service applications in the cloud. Use [Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/overview) to create a CI/CD pipeline to build your containerized applications, deploy them to the [Azure Container Registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/), run web sites directly in [Azure App Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/), and run multi-container systems at scale using the [Azure Container Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-service/).  

## Storage

The [Azure Data Lake Tools for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usqlextpublisher.usql-vscode-ext) make it easy to develop U-SQL projects against [Azure Data Lake](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-lake-store/)! This extension provides a cross-platform, light-weight, keyboard-focused authoring experience for U-SQL while maintaining a full set of development functions. 

## Databases

The [mssql preview for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-mssql.mssql) extension provides support for developing [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2016), [Azure SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/) and [SQL Data Warehouse](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-data-warehouse/) with a rich set of functionalities.

For example, create and manage connection profiles and most recently used connections. Write T-SQL script with IntelliSense, snippets, syntax colorizations, error validations and GO batch separator. Execute scripts, view the results in a document, and save results to json or csv file format and view in the editor.


## Internet of Things

The [Azure IoT Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.azure-iot-toolkit) for VS Code makes it easy to develop and connect your [IoT applications to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/index#pivot=services&panel=iot). With this extension, you can send messages to the Azure IoT Hub (device-to-cloud message), monitor device-to-cloud messages, manage devices, and discove devices connected via Ethernet, USB serial, and over WiFi.
